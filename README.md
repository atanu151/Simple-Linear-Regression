# Simple-Linear-Regression
Linear Regression : The very first model I learnt while pursuing my Masters in Data Analytics, and also the first task of my internship at The Sparks Foundation.

Simply put, Linear Regression tells us about the relationship between two variables. And once we have established that there is a strong correlation between the two variables, then we can predict the dependent variable given the independent one.

In this supervised machine learning task (#Task2), I am trying to predict the Percentage of Marks obtained by a student, given the number of Hours studied.

Problem Statement: What will be the predicted score if a student study 9.25 hours a day ?
